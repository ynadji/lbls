== LBLS - LIWC But Less Shitty ==
Zoey had to use this terrible program called LIWC (http://www.liwc.net/). It
kept fucking up when she tried to parse multiple files at once, so I wrote a
Python clone in an hour or so.

lbls.py expects a LIWC dictionary file (liwcdict.txt in repository) and an
input file of two columns. The first column contains an identifier and the
second column contains text with which is processed as LIWC processes text. The
LIWC data frame is output to stdout.

== sample_input.txt ==
1       This cruise sucked dude. Do not buy cruises from these people.
3       "We went on a cruise and it was awful. ..."
4       "The cruise was a big disappointment. ..."
...

= Running =
$ ./lbls.py liwcdict.txt sample_input.txt > sample_input.liwc.txt
